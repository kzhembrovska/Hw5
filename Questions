In Knight Rider, why does each LED require its own pin?

        - Each LED requires it's own pin because each light has it's own specific command 
          of when it needs to turn on or off.
          Knight Rider is an extension of blink.


Why is Knight Rider 2 in the Arduino tutorial so much shorter than Knight Rider 1?

        - In the first the LEDs are being told to blink eight times over individually like a single LED bulb
          would. Whereas in the second, a for(;;) function is used to preform the same thing, bu tin fewer
          lines.

What resistor value should be used with the LEDs?

        - 220 Ohm resistors
